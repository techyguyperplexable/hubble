# Hubble - A USB Recovery Tool for devices based on Exynos9830

## Why?
 - Why not?
 - I don't want people to be paying to unbrick their devices

## Platform preperation

### Linux

- Open or create ```/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules``` as **root**
- Add the following lines to the file
```
# Samsung Exynos USB Boot Mode
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="04e8", ATTR{idProduct}=="1234", MODE="0660", GROUP="dialout"
```
- Save the file and exit your editor
- Run ```sudo udevadm control --reload && sudo udevadm trigger``` to reload UDEV rules
- You can now run the tool.

### Windows

- Uninstall any existing BootROM Drivers
- Import the needed certificates by double clicking the ```## Driver Certificate (INSTALL ME FIRST BEFORE THE DRIVER).reg``` file and importing the regkeys
- Install the ones provided by right clicking the inf and pressing install
- You can now run the tool.

## How do I use it?
 - Install required python packages via ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
 - Run the tool, pointing to your bootloader tar file via ```python3 hubble.py -b <PATH_TO_BL_TAR>```
 - Plug in your bricked phone
 - Let it run it's magic
 - Reflash the stock firmware
