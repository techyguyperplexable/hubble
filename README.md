# Hubble - A USB Recovery Tool for devices based on Exynos9830 or Exynos9820 And Exynos9611 (soon)

## Why?
 - Why not?
 - I don't want people to be paying to unbrick their devices

## Environment preparation

### Linux

- Run ```bash udev_rules.sh``` as root to setup udev rules
- You can now run the tool.

### Windows

- Uninstall any existing BootROM Drivers
- Import the needed certificates by double clicking the ```## Driver Certificate (INSTALL ME FIRST BEFORE THE DRIVER).reg``` file and importing the regkeys
- Install the ones provided by right clicking the inf and pressing install
- You can now run the tool.

## How to use
 - Install required python packages via ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
 - Run the tool, pointing to your bootloader tar file via ```python3 hubble.py -b <PATH_TO_BL_TAR>```
 - Plug in your bricked phone
 - Let it run it's magic
 - Reflash the stock firmware
